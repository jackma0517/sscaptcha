        <p>
            Classical captchas based solely on recognizing distorted text have become weak due to the 
            advances in Optical Character Recognition, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. 
            Currently, industry practice is moving towards intrusively tracking the users’ data to 
            determine if they’re behaving as expected.                 
        </p>
        <p>
            S.S.CAPTCHA (Simon Says CAPTCHA) aims to show the feasibility of secure bot detection systems in the current age, 
            while maintaining the classic challenge/response format. Along with not intrusively 
            tracking user’s data, we worked to not add extra noise to images as well as decrease 
            usability by adding an overwhelming amount of images to solve.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using biometric analysis of mouse movements over the CAPTCHA image, along with 
            context-based instruction, and image recognition, SSCAPTCHA combines three areas that are 
            problematic for bots to solve in order to prevent them from accessing resources while
            maintaining usability for humans.
