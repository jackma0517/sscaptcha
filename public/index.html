        <p>
            Classical captchas based solely on recognizing distorted text have become weak due to the 
            advances in Optical Character Recognition, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. 
            Currently industry practice is moving towards intrusively tracking the users’ data to 
            determine if they’re behaving as expected.                 
        </p>
        <p> S.S.CAPTCHA (Simon Says CAPTCHA)  involves the interpretation of context-based 
            instructions for users to perform, requiring them to make specific actions involving 
            mouse movements. 
            This combines three areas that are problematic for bots to perform correctly: 
            image recognition, interpretation of context-based commands, and mimicking user action. 
            The combination of these increases the difficulty of bots to correctly solve our CAPTCHA, 
            while not significantly increasing the difficulty for human users.
        </p>
        <p>
            SSCAPTCHA aims to show the feasibility of secure bot detection systems in the current age, 
            while maintaining the classic challenge/response format. Along with not intrusively 
            tracking user’s data, we worked to not add extra noise to images as well as decrease 
            usability by adding an overwhelming amount of images to solve.

            By using biometric analysis of mouse movements over the CAPTCHA image, along with 
            context-based instruction, and image recognition, SSCAPTCHA combines three areas that are 
            problematic for bots to solve,  in order to prevent them from accessing resources while
            maintaining usability for humans.
